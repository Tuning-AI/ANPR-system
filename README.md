## About This Project :

**Algerine real-time Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system** is an advanced technology that combines the power of 
computer vision and deep learning to recognize and interpret license plate information from vehicles in real-time. 
* This system is built using the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 object detection algorithm and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. 
* The system can detect and read number plates from live video feeds or recorded footage from cameras, making it an ideal solution for traffic management,
law enforcement, and parking management applications.
* With its high accuracy, speed, and real-time capabilities, this system is changing the way number plate recognition is performed, making it more efficient and reliable than ever before.

## Number Plate Dataset 
Collection of images and associated data related to vehicle license plates within the country of Algeria. This dataset contains a diverse range of images capturing different types of license plates, such as standard civilian plates, government plates, and possibly specialized plates for various purposes

## YOLOv8
**YOLOv8** is a state-of-the-art object detection and image segmentation model developed by Ultralytics. It is the latest version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models, which are known for their speed and accuracy.

## EasyOCR
EasyOCR is a Python library for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) that allows you to easily extract text from images and scanned documents. It is a general OCR that can read both natural scene text and dense text in a document. It currently supports over 80 languages and all popular writing scripts, including Latin, Chinese, Arabic, Devanagari, and Cyrillic.
